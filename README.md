# Giacomo_Tasks

This app is called "Giacomo", named after the street that my good friends and I live on. It was initially created to organize household chores, but eventually evolved to perform other functions. The below items are a prospective list of what this app will enable my housemates and I to do:

Create, Delete, Edit, and Reserve chores
Reserve gym (weight room) time
View and edit a grocery list
View Contact / Social links of housemates and important contacts (i.e. landlord, etc.)
