# Giacomo_Tasks

This app is called "Giacomo", named after the street that my good friends and I live on. It was initially created to organize household chores, but eventually evolved to perform other functions. The below items are a prospective list of what this app will enable my housemates and I to do:

<p> - Create, Delete, Edit, and Reserve chores </p>
<p> - Reserve gym (weight room) time </p>
<p> - View and edit a grocery list </p>
<p> - View Contact / Social links of housemates and important contacts (i.e. landlord, etc.) </p>
